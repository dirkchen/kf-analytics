1. 
Put FreqCounter.py in one folder with vocabulary (.txt) and the file
that needs to be parsed (.csv). Names of these files are not important.
The original folder must have three files:
-FreqCounter.py
-Vocabulary of .txt format (space separated words/phrases)
-Excel file of .csv format (only third column will be processed)

2.
Double-click FreqCounter.py, it will produce a file (.txt) with 
the same name as original .csv file

3.
The output file contains ONLY the frequency of words that 
were menitoned in the original .csv file according to the vocabulary.
Other words that had zero frequency are omitted in the output file
